# BearHub

#### About
BearHub is a project that started when a local guesthouse in my hometown asked me to create them a beer tracking application. The project was built using React.js and Express.js.

#### Running a local instance

- Backend: `npm run start` while you are in the folder called backend. A server will start and generate the local data folders automatically.
- Frontend: `npm run build` to compile the data. Then a single-paged website will be generated in the `dist` folder.
